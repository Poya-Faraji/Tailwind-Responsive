# Responsive Landing Page with Vite and Tailwind CSS

This project is a responsive landing page created using Vite and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easily customizable. Below are instructions on how to install the necessary packages and run the development code locally.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Poya-Faraji/Tailwind-Responsive.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd 'Landig-Pages/landing-page-template'
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary dependencies required for the project.

## Running the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server locally. This will allow you to view and make changes to the landing page.

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server and provide you with a local URL where you can view the landing page in your browser.

2. **Open your browser:**

   Once the development server is running, open your preferred web browser and navigate to the following URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:"port in  CLI"
   ```

   This will load the landing page in your browser, and any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected without the need to refresh the page.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the landing page to suit your needs. You can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the project directory. Tailwind CSS provides a rich set of utility classes that make it easy to style and layout your content.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your landing page, you can build the project for production using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a optimized build of your project in the `dist` directory, which you can then deploy to your web server or hosting provider.
